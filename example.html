      This image shows a traditional Thai food platter presented on a round woven bamboo tray. 
      In the center, there is a bowl of Tom Yum soup garnished with cilantro and red chili peppers.
      Clockwise from the top, there's a serving of Pad Thai noodles with shrimp and lime wedges,
      a small bowl of green curry with Thai basil leaves floating on top, mango sticky rice with sesame seeds,
      and fresh vegetable spring rolls with a peanut dipping sauce.
      The entire platter is arranged symmetrically with vibrant colors—red, green, yellow, and orange—highlighting 
      the diversity and balance of Thai cuisine.
